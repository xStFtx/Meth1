I have made a few math repos before. But I am currently researching gauge theory. As a 20 year old. Gauge theory is quite intimidating but also thrilling. I enjoy these complex maths that push the boundaries of math and can be applied to physics and coding. So that is why I am writing some random progrmas with it. This is a first of many organized math repos.
